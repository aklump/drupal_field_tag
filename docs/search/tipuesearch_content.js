Developers may take advantage of this additional metadata when manipulating fields.  The use case for which this was written is this.  Allow the tagging of images on an multiple value image field to indicate which image is the hero image, which image is the thumb image, and untagged images are just that.  It allows the content managers to indicate the role the image is playing for that given entity.  Visit https:\/\/aklump.github.io\/field_tag for full documentation.  About Tags   Tags are not case-sensitive. Tags may contain inner spaces, but neither leading nor trailing spaces. Multiple tags must separated by a comma or \"comma+space\", e.g. 'foo,bar' or 'foo, bar'.   Configuration   Enable this module. Visit the Manage fields page for the entity you've picked. Click on the Edit button for the given field. Enable the Field Tag, and adjust settings as necessary.   Give the permission Use field tagging to the correct user roles. Visit an entity edit page and make sure you see the tag field as configured.   Developers  This provides the UI and storage mechanism for field content tagging.
