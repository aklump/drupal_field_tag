It broke somewhere along the way and there is no test coverage yet.  Still no test coverage.\n\n## [0.6.0] - 2024-03-13\n\n### Added\n\n- The `Drupal\\field_tag\\Rule\\Rule::CALLABLE` condition. See docs for usage info.\n\n## [0.5.0] - 2023-08-13\n\n### Added\n\n- `hook_field_tag_validation_rules()`  You can now add constraints to your field_tag use cases. See _field_tag.api.php_ for more info.\n\n## [0.4.0] - 2023-03-01\n\n### Changed\n\n- The `\\Drupal\\field_tag\\Event\\TagEvent` now delivers an instance of FieldTag that has only the added or removed tags.

Allow the tagging of images on an multiple value image field to indicate which image is the `hero` image, which image is the `thumb` image, and untagged images are just that. It allows the content managers to indicate the role the image is playing for that given entity.\n\n**Visit  for full documentation.**\n\n## About Tags\n\n* The field tag input box is a CSV string separating one or more tags, e.g. `foo` or `foo, bar`.\n* Tags are not case-sensitive.\n* Tags may contain spaces.\n* Tags must be unique; duplicates will be removed.\n\n## Install with Composer\n\n1. Because this is an unpublished package, you must define it's repository in\n   your project's _composer.json_ file. Add the following to _composer.json_ in\n   the `repositories` array:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n     \"type\": \"github\",\n     \"url\": \"https:\/\/github.com\/aklump\/drupal_field_tag\"\n    }\n    ```\n1. Require this package:\n\n    ```\n    composer require drupal\/field_tag:^0.7\n    ```\n1. Add the installed directory to _.gitignore_\n\n   ```php\n   \/web\/modules\/custom\/field_tag\/\n   ```\n\n## Configuration\n\n1. Enable this module.\n1. Visit the _Manage fields_ page for the entity you've picked.\n1. Click on the _Edit_ button for the given field.\n1. Enable the _Field Tag_, and adjust settings as necessary.  ![Settings](..\/..\/images\/settings.jpg)\n1. Give the permission _Use field tagging_ to the correct user roles.\n1. Visit an entity edit page and make sure you see the tag field as configured.\n\n### What Happens When a Field is Deleted\n\nThe field tags themselves exist as `FieldTag` entity instances. When a field which is _field tag enabled_ on an entity type is deleted, all field tags that are associated with that entity type\/field are marked with a `1` in the `deleted` column in the `field_tag` table. They still exist in the database but are not going to load via the normal field tag API, attach methods, etc. You can still load them using `FieldTag::load()` if necessary, or access them via the database for reference.\n\n## Manage form display\n\n1. Node forms will include a list of field tags in the Advanced area, but only if one or more fields have field tags enabled.\n1. You may control this form element by going to _Manage form display_ for a given node type and changing the weight or disabling this element.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you find this project useful... please consider [making a donation](https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=4E5KZHDQCEUV8&item_name=Gratitude%20for%20aklump%2Ffield_tag).\n\n## Contact The Developer\n\n* In the Loft Studios\n* Aaron Klump - Web Developer\n* sourcecode@intheloftstudios.com\n* 360.690.6432\n* PO Box 29294 Bellingham, WA 98228-1294\n*\n*"},{"id":"issues","title":"Known Issues","body":"## Cannot Tag Some Empty Items\n\nIf you try to add a tag to a textfield that is empty, and save the entity, the tag will not save.\n\n![title](..\/..\/images\/issue1.png)\n\nHowever, if you tag an item and then later remove the value making it empty, the tag remains."},{"id":"relationships","title":"Relationships","body":"The field tag entities are related to a given field on a parent entity.

Every rule change requires that you rebuild the Drupal caches.\n\nThe rules are implemented as [entity and field constraints](https:\/\/www.drupal.org\/docs\/drupal-apis\/entity-api\/entity-validation-api\/entity-validation-api-overview). @see `\\Drupal\\field_tag\\Plugin\\Validation\\Constraint\\FieldTagConstraint`.\n\n## Explained\n\nEach rule consists of two parts: 1) the conditions to be met to apply the rule and 2) the requirements that must be met if the rule is applied.\n\n## When Are Rules Applied?\n\nWhen the entity is saved.\n\n## When Does a Rule Apply?\n\nWhen all the `condition` statements are `TRUE`.\n\n## Must All Condition Clauses Be True?\n\nYes, or the rule is skipped.\n\n## Must All Require Clauses Be True?\n\nYes, or the rule is in violation.\n\n## Callable Condition Explained\n\nThe trump condition is the `Drupal\\field_tag\\Rule\\Rule::CALLABLE`. Here's how you might use that. Notice the arguments may be `NULL`.  If you do not return a value, `FALSE` is assumed and the condition is considered unmet, and the rule skipped.  **Each rule may have only one callable condition.**\n\n```php\n$callable = function (\n  ?\\Drupal\\Core\\Entity\\EntityInterface $entity,\n  ?\\Drupal\\Core\\Field\\FieldItemListInterface $item_list\n): bool {\n  \/\/ Do something that returns a bool.\n};\n\n$rule = (new Drupal\\field_tag\\Rule\\Rule())\n  ->condition(Drupal\\field_tag\\Rule\\Rule::CALLABLE, $callable)\n  ->require(Drupal\\field_tag\\Rule\\Rule::TAG_VALUE, 'foo')\n  ->require(Drupal\\field_tag\\Rule\\Rule::TAG_MIN_PER_ENTITY, 1);\n```"},{"id":"events","title":"Tag-Related Events","body":"If you need to react to a tag being added or removed you can subscribe to the event(s): `\\Drupal\\field_tag\\Event\\FieldTagEvents::TAG_REMOVED` and\/or `\\Drupal\\field_tag\\Event\\FieldTagEvents::TAG_ADDED`.\n\nSee `\\Drupal\\field_tag\\Event\\TagEvent`, for the context available.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```php\nclass Foo implements \\Symfony\\Component\\EventDispatcher\\EventSubscriberInterface {\n\n  public static function getSubscribedEvents() {\n    return [\n      \\Drupal\\field_tag\\Event\\FieldTagEvents::TAG_ADDED => 'invalidateBlockCache',\n      \\Drupal\\field_tag\\Event\\FieldTagEvents::TAG_REMOVED => 'invalidateBlockCache',\n    ];\n  }\n\n  public function invalidateBlockCache(TagEvent $event) {\n\n    \/\/ If we see the \"highlights\" tag adding\/removing, we need to rebuild the\n    \/\/ highlights block (id 17), so we have to invalidate the cache tag.\n    if ($event->getFieldTag()->has('highlights') {\n      $cid = 'block_content:17';\n      $this->cacheTagsInvalidator->invalidateTags([$cid]);\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Deleting Parent Entities\n\nWhen parent entities (those with field tagging enabled) are deleted, the associated field tag entities are also deleted. This also fires the `\\Drupal\\field_tag\\Event\\FieldTagEvents::TAG_REMOVED` event."},{"id":"testing","title":"Testing","body":"## Unit Tests\n\n1.
