<p>The field tag entities are related to a given field on a parent entity. Specifically to a single delta on said field. In other words, the thing that is tagged by a <code>field_tag</code> entity can only be known when you have: entity + field + delta.</p>

<p>There is a possible further relationship <strong>when the field is an entity reference field</strong> such as a file field or a paragraph. In this case the field tag will be related to the target entity as well.</p>
